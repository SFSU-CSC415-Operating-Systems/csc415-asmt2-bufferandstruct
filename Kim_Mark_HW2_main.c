* Description: This project populates a struct (personalInfo) provided by 
* assignment2.h.  In addition, this program retrieves a set of strings
* from assignment2.h and copies them to a buffer by sequentially filling
* it in its entirety before committing and clearing the buffer for
* subsequent copies.
